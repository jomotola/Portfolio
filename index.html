        <p>My first introduction into computer science was my 6th grade media class, where we'd use Scratch to make litle games.
          That class set me on path and began taking PLTW classes in middle school. I was really excited when my high school had a computer science pathway, so I chose it. 
          During that class, my teacher invited to the Nextech Navigate conference, which was when I found the internship opporutnity. Applying was the best decision I made because of the knowledge I gained and the community I became part of.
          After this program, I want to continue in computer science and and explore more engineering.
